       Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read /
       easy-to-write structured text format into HTML. Markdown's text format
       is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features such
       as headers, *emphasis*, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.

       Markdown's syntax is designed not as a generic markup language, but
       specifically to serve as a front-end to (X)HTML. You can  use span-
       level HTML tags anywhere in a Markdown document, and you can use block
       level HTML tags (like <div> and <table> as well).

       For more information about Markdown's syntax, see:

       Use "--" to end switch parsing. For example, to open a file named "-z",
       use:

               markdown -- -z

       ----hhttmmll44ttaaggss
           Use HTML 4 style for empty element tags, e.g.:

               <br>

           instead of Markdown's default XHTML style tags, e.g.:

               <br />

       --vv, ----vveerrssiioonn
           Display Markdown's version number and copyright information.

       --ss, ----sshhoorrttvveerrssiioonn
           Display the short-form version number.
